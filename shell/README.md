# Unix Shell

This program implements a basic shell with all the functionality detailed in the lab assignment. It accepts standard unix syntax for commands and parameters. It incorporates, child processes and uses execve to run that command with the attached arguments. If the command is not found the shell will display command not found and you can easily exit the shell by typing exit. Additional features added are support for change of directory, redirects of input and output and pipes.
